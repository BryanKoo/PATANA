# PATANA
PATent ANAlysis project 

Prior art for a patent is searched many times during the life cycle of a patent.
It is because novelty is one of the most important patentability.
Though it may be difficult for AI to determine whether a patent have novelty or not.
AI can help human to determine it by creating search term and screening irrelevant patents from search results.

This project is about development of AI NLP algorithm based on up-to-date ML technology for the patent analysis.
Because patents are written with natural written language, not spoken language in technology domain.
This project seeks to contribute to the NLP technology area.
