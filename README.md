# PATANA
PATent ANAlysis project 

Prior arts for a patent are searched many times during the life cycle of a patent.
It is because novelty is one of the most important factor for determining patentability.
Though it may be difficult yet for AI to determine whether a patent have novelty or not.
AI can help human by suggesting search term and screening irrelevant patents from search results.

This project is about development of AI NLP algorithm based on up-to-date ML technology for the patent analysis.
Patents are written with natural written language, not spoken language in technology domain.
This project starts with developing technology for screening irrelevant patents for Korean patents first.
Working with other languages and suggesting search term and will be followed.
