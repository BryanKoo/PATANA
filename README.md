PATent ANAlysis project 

Prior art for a patent is searched many times during the life cycle of a patent.
It is because novelty is one of the most important patentability.
Though it may be difficult for AI to determine whether a patent have novelty or not.
AI can help human to determine it by creating search term and screening irrelevant patents from search results.
